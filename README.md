# 👋 Hi, I'm Prasanna Sriram

**Data Analyst | Business Analyst | Data Engineer | Data Scientist**

I’m a data professional with 5+ years of experience turning messy datasets into insights that drive decisions. My sweet spot is combining technical depth with business context — whether that’s building SQL pipelines, automating workflows in Python, or designing BI dashboards in Power BI and Tableau that actually get used.

Over the years, I’ve helped leadership hire faster, retain talent, recover revenue leaks, forecast more accurately, and understand customers better. I enjoy working across the full data lifecycle — from cleaning and modelling to visualization and storytelling — and I thrive on making data accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.
